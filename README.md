## Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Waving%20Hand%20Light%20Skin%20Tone.png" alt="Waving Hand Light Skin Tone" width="25" height="25" />

I’m $$\color{magenta} Marina$$ a geospatial data analyst with a strong academic background in statistics and geoinformation systems, including a remote sensing–focused thesis for my MSc in Geospatial thecnologies.

I design and build geoinformation-driven solutions to explore, analyze, and communicate spatial patterns. 

My Tech stack:

⟶ GIS: QGIS, ArcGIS. 

⟶ Remote sensing: Google Earth Engine, ESA SNAP, Orfeo Toolbox. 

⟶ Databases and data management: PostgreSQL/PostGIS, PgAdmin, GeoNetwork, Open ModelSphere.

⟶ Programming and automation: Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PowerQuery.

Fun facts, I enjoy mixing maps with literature and pop references as I believe maps are not just analytical tools, but also narrative devices.
